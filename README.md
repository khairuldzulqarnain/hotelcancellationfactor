Sugges􀆟ons :
1. Cancella􀆟on rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancella􀆟ons of reserva􀆟ons,
hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels
based on loca􀆟ons. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
2. As the ra􀆟o of the cancella􀆟on and not cancella􀆟on of the resort hotel is higher in the
resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the
room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marke􀆟ng with a reasonable
amount to increase their revenue as the cancella􀆟on is the highest in this month.
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to
reduce the cancella􀆟on rate.
